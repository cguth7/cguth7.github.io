## An imp approaches out of thin air...

He offers to play a game with you. 

In the game, the imp gives you a die to roll. He will give you a dollar if you roll a 1, 2 dollars if you roll a two, etc. 

He tells you that the game costs three dollars to play. You are indifferent between losing a dollar and gaining a dollar. 

Should you play the game?

If you aren't sure, how could you figure out?

# Hello expected value!

When we roll a die, we know there are 6 possible outcomes.

| Side  |
| ------------- |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |

But that isn't all we know...

We also know that each outcome has an equal chance of occuring. 

When we weight every outcome by its chance of occuring, we have found the *expected value* of the action.


| Side  | probability | product  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 1/6  | 1/6  | 
| 2  | 1/6  | 2/6 | 
| 3 | 1/6  | 3/6  | 
| 4  | 1/6  | 4/6 | 
| 5 | 1/6  | 5/6  | 
| 6  | 1/6  | 6/6 | 

We sum up the products to get the expected value.

Answer: 3.5


Assuming you know what an average, or mean is, you might be wondering, isn't 3.5 the average value of a side of die? What was so special about what we did?

If you had that thought, congradulations! you are correct. In the case of die, the expected value and Average are the same. Try to think about why this is the case.
