## An imp approaches out of thin air...

He offers to play a game with you. 

In the game, the imp gives you a die to roll. He will give you a dollar if you roll a 1, 2 dollars if you roll a two, etc. 

He tells you that the game costs three dollars to play. You are indifferent between losing a dollar and gaining a dollar. 

Should you play the game?

If you aren't sure, how could you figure out?

Your first thought should be, if I roll a die, I need to make 3 dollars or more per roll for this game to be worth it. So now the question becomes, how can you figure out how much money you should expect to make per roll. 

# Hello expected value!
When we weight every outcome by its chance of occuring, we have found the *expected value* of the action.

| Side  | probability | product  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 1/6  | 1/6  | 
| 2  | 1/6  | 2/6 | 
| 3 | 1/6  | 3/6  | 
| 4  | 1/6  | 4/6 | 
| 5 | 1/6  | 5/6  | 
| 6  | 1/6  | 6/6 | 

We sum up the products to get the expected value.

Answer: 3.5


Assuming you know what an average is, you might be thinking, isn't this just the average? Why do we have this fancy name for it? 

If you had that thought, congratulations!(The average is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5). you are correct. In this case. 

See, a each outcome in a die has an equal chance of occuring. The important thing to understand is that this is very, very, special!

# Hi!

Average is a *specific* type of expected value. It is the expected value of an action when each outcome is equally likely. 

When we have a bunch of outcomes that are equally likely to occur, we don't have to individually weight each outcome. 
Rather we can do the more familiar (in the case of die) (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6. 
And if you are confused, remember that 1x1/6 + .... + 6x1/6 = (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6

# But what if the dice weren't fair?

When we roll a die, we know there are 6 possible outcomes. 

| Side  |
| ------------- |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |

If our die has a magnetic side 6 and we roll it onto an iron table, we might expect something more like the following. 


| Side  | probability | product  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 1/6  | 0/6  | 
| 2  | 1/6  | 0/6 | 
| 3 | 1/6  | 0/6  | 
| 4  | 1/6  | 0/6 | 
| 5 | 1/6  | 0/6  | 
| 6  | 6/6  | 36/6 | 

We sum up the products to get the expected value.

Answer: 6

Now we see that expected value and average are completely different!
