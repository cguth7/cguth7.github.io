            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The FDA Orange Book contains patents protecting FDA-approved drugs. This analysis compares Orange Book patents against all pharmaceutical patents in our GWAS spillover dataset to understand how approved drug patents differ from the broader patent landscape.</p>

            <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orange Book patents:</strong> 6,411 unique patent IDs</li>
                <li><strong>Matched in dataset:</strong> 1,405 patents (21.9%)</li>
                <li><strong>Panel cells with OB patents:</strong> 511,713 (0.35% of 148M)</li>
                <li><strong>Total OB patent count:</strong> 608,778</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Orange Book patent IDs were downloaded from the FDA (January 2025) and matched against BioBERT-extracted patent-gene-disease associations. Patent counts were aggregated to the gene-disease-year level and merged with the GWAS spillover panel.</p>

            <h3>Stata Usage</h3>

* For sparse counts, consider Poisson:
