Quantitative claims (e.g., \u201creduced\u2026A\u03b2 by about 50%,\u201d benefit seen after \u201c4 to 7 months\u201d) are given without statistical context, making it impossible to assess evidential strength or detect p-hacking/reporting artifacts."

Missingness across modalities is visible (e.g., baseline pNfL/MRI counts differ), but eligibility required \u22652 follow-ups for MRI/pNfL/cognition and the paper performs sensitivity analyses for overlapping timepoints, reducing concern. No unexplained dropouts/exclusions beyond modality availability."

Uncertainty is reported via confidence intervals for required sample sizes and bootstrapping procedures are described. However, there are many cross-biomarker comparisons and significance testing without clear multiplicity correction discussion, which modestly increases concern."

          "score": 4.0,
          "reasoning": "Methods are generally replicable: explicit cohort definitions (A\u03b2+/\u2212 with PET/CSF cutoffs), MRI processing pipeline (FreeSurfer v5.1), PET SUVR estimation approach, pNfL assay description, and R packages (nlme, longpower) are specified with a power formula provided. Pre-registration is not mentioned and analysis code is not openly posted (only 'available upon request'), which reduces transparency."

However, downstream cluster/subgroup analyses create smaller cells (e.g., ADNI-GO/2 cluster 4 n=44; several post hoc comparisons and longitudinal analyses are restricted to late MCI only), and no formal power analysis is described. Early MCI exclusion is explained (only recruited in ADNI-GO/2), so this is not an unexplained exclusion."

Models and covariates are described (ANCOVA with age/gender/education/APOE; mixed-effects; Cox model). Main concern is limited reporting of uncertainty/effect magnitude in places: many results are presented primarily as P-values (often shown as \"<0.0001\"/\"\u22640.0001\"), with limited confidence intervals in the provided text/tables (e.g., hazard ratio"

Replication across ADNI-1 vs ADNI-GO/2 is discussed.

No obvious domain-specific image-manipulation risk signals (e.g., western blots) apply here.

The study leverages a large ADNI sample with generally appropriate statistical controls (Bonferroni/FDR) and reasonably transparent imaging/method descriptions.
